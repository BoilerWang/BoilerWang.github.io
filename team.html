      <p>Name: Qing Jiang, PhD</p>
      <p>Position: Professor from the Department of Nutrition Science at Purdue University</p>
      <p>Introduction: Qing Jiang got her Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Chemistry from Peking University, and Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Washington State University. 
      Dr. Jiang is currently a Professor in the Department of Nutrition Science at Purdue University. Dr. Jiang is the director of Interdepartmental Nutrition Graduate Program. 
      Her research has focused on different forms of vitamin E and novel vitamin E metabolites, long-chain carboxychromanols. 
      Using cell-based studies and animal models, Dr. Jiang pioneered in identifying anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects of gamma-tocopherol. 
      Her lab has identified new vitamin E metabolites and is the first to show that long-chain carboxychromanols are inhibitors pro-inflammatory enzymes, have anticancer effects and modulate gut microbiota. 
      Dr. Jiang’s lab has developed analytical methods for vitamin E metabolomics. 
      Dr. Jiang has authored in over 60 publications and obtained four patents. She is on the editorial board of Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry. 
      She has served as a reviewer in study sections of NIH and USDA as well as numerous scientific journals. 
      She is a recipient of E.L.R. Stokstad Award for outstanding fundamental research in nutrition from American Society for Nutrition and University Faculty Scholar Award from Purdue University.</p>
